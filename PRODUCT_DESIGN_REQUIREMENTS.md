# Product Design Requirements: ChronoHistory

## 1. Introduction

ChronoHistory is a mobile application that allows users to visually compare timelines from different historical or thematic categories. The goal is to provide an intuitive and engaging platform for understanding the concurrence and relationships between historical events.

## 2. Target Audience

* Students (history, social sciences, etc.)
* Educators
* History enthusiasts
* Lifelong learners
* Researchers looking for a quick overview of event overlaps

## 3. Goals

* **Primary Goal:** Enable users to easily select and compare multiple timelines side-by-side (or in a closely integrated view).
* **Secondary Goal:** Provide a clear, interactive, and visually appealing representation of historical events and their temporal relationships.
* **Tertiary Goal:** Allow users to explore basic details of specific events within the timelines.

## 4. Key Features & Functionality

### 4.1. Category Selection (`category_selection_view.dart`)

* **F4.1.1:** Display a list/grid of available timeline categories (e.g., "Roman Empire," "Renaissance Art," "Space Race").
  * **UI:** Visually distinct cards or list items for each category.
  * **Interaction:** Tappable elements to select/deselect categories.
* **F4.1.2:** Allow selection of multiple categories for comparison (e.g., 2-4 categories at a time).
  * **Feedback:** Clear visual indication of selected categories.
* **F4.1.3:** "Compare Timelines" button.
  * **Action:** Navigates to the `ChronoComparisonView` with the selected categories.
  * **Validation:** Button should be enabled only if a valid number of categories (e.g., at least 2) are selected.
* **F4.1.4:** Responsive layout for various mobile screen sizes.
  * **Behavior:** Grid columns or list layout should adjust to screen width.
  * **Behavior:** Text and elements should resize or wrap appropriately to avoid overflow.

### 4.2. Timeline Comparison View (`chrono_comparison_view.dart`)

* **F4.2.1:** Display selected timelines in a clear, linear, and scrollable format.
  * **UI:** Each timeline should be distinctly represented.
  * **Metaphor:** Move away from the previous "orbiting circles" to a more conventional top-to-bottom or left-to-right scrollable timeline.
  * **Scrolling:** Smooth vertical scrolling to navigate through time across all displayed timelines simultaneously.
* **F4.2.2:** Central Time Axis/Markers.
  * **UI:** Clear indication of dates/years along the scrollable axis.
  * **Dynamic:** Axis should update as the user scrolls.
* **F4.2.3:** Event Representation.
  * **UI:** Events displayed bars with a nice description and image bellow it along their respective timelines, positioned according to their date.
  * **Information:** Display event titles or key information directly on the timeline if space permits, or via pull-up panes on interaction.
  * **Clarity:** Avoid visual clutter, especially when many events are close together.
* **F4.2.4:** Event Interaction & Detail Display.
  * **Interaction:** Tapping on an event should reveal more details.
  * **UI:** A modal, bottom sheet, or an expanding section to show event description, images, and other relevant data.
* **F4.2.5:** Dynamic AppBar.
  * **UI:** AppBar should display the names of the categories being compared.
* **F4.2.6:** Zoom and Pan (Optional - Post-MVP for linear view).
  * **Interaction:** Pinch-to-zoom to adjust the time scale.
  * **Interaction:** Drag to pan along the time axis to increase level of details (LOD), which changes the time scale. sub events of a greater event may come to view smoothly as user zooms in.
* **F4.2.7:** Clear Indication of Timelines.
  * **UI:** Each timeline should be clearly labeled with its category name.

### 4.3. Data Handling & State Management (`timeline_provider.dart`, `timeline_event.dart`)

* **F4.3.1:** Efficiently load and manage timeline data for selected categories.
* **F4.3.2:** Manage the application state, including selected categories, current view, and interaction states (e.g., selected event).

## 5. User Interface & User Experience (UI/UX)

* **U5.1:** **Clarity:** Information should be presented in an easy-to-understand manner. Avoid jargon where possible or provide explanations.
* **U5.2:** **Consistency:** UI elements and interactions should be consistent throughout the app.
* **U5.3:** **Responsiveness:** The app must perform smoothly, especially during scrolling and animations.
* **U5.4:** **Aesthetics:** A clean, modern, and visually appealing design that enhances the user's engagement with historical content.
* **U5.5:** **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should be able to navigate between category selection and timeline comparison views easily.
* **U5.6:** **Feedback:** The app should provide clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., button presses, selections).

## 6. Technical Requirements (Non-Functional)

* **T6.1:** **Platform:** Flutter (iOS and Android).
* **T6.2:** **Performance:** Smooth scrolling and interactions, aiming for 60fps.
* **T6.3:** **Scalability:** The architecture should allow for adding new categories and more detailed event data in the future.
* **T6.4:** **Maintainability:** Code should be well-organized, commented, and follow Dart/Flutter best practices.

## 7. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

* Search functionality within timelines.
* Filtering events by sub-categories or keywords.
* Saving favorite comparisons.
* User accounts.
* Adding custom events or timelines.
* Multimedia content for events (images, videos, links).
* Horizontal timeline view option.

## 8. Open Questions / Design Challenges

* **O8.1:** How to best represent overlapping events from different timelines without cluttering the UI in the new linear view?
* **O8.2:** What is the optimal way to handle very long timelines with sparse events versus short timelines with dense events in a unified scrollable view?
* **O8.3:** Detailed design for the event detail pop-up/modal â€“ what information to prioritize?

This document will be updated as the project progresses and new insights are gained.
